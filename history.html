            <p>In 1835, Rev. Joseph Marsh started a private school at the back verandah of the church called the 
                  Hill Street Academy for twenty students from the upper class community situated at Hill Street, Pettah.
            </p>
            <p>Then in the following year in 1836, Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton, the British Governor of Ceylon, based on the recommendations of the Colebrooke Commission, established the Colombo Academy,
                  as an English public school modeled on Eton College, with Rev. Joseph Marsh continuing as headmaster on government pay. It was the oldest public school on the island and had the governor as its patron.
                  It gave the children of leading Ceylonese families an education which would make them fit to be citizens of the British Empire and served as the principal public school and a model for other government schools that were to be built in Ceylon. 
                  In 1836 the school was moved to San Sebastian Hill, Pettah, (prior to which it was at Maradana, next to Hulftsdorp); it would stay there for another 75 years before being shifted to Thurstan Road.
                  Even though the college had close ties to Anglicanism in its early years since 1836 it has remained a secular school.
            </p>
            <p>In 1859 the Queen's College, Colombo was established as the first institution of higher education in Ceylon. Affiliated to the University of Calcutta,
            it prepared students from the Colombo Academy for entrance examinations of English universities.
            In 1865 the Morgan Committee of inquiry into education recommended that it be reorganized and that scholarships should be awarded to study at the University of Oxford,
            and as a result in 1869, Queen's College was amalgamated with the Colombo Academy. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The first hostel of the Colombo Academy was established in San Sebastian in 1868, establishing it as one of the first boarding schools in Ceylon.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 1881 it was renamed Royal College Colombo with the royal consent of Queen Victoria.
            The Gazette notification giving Her Majesty's approval to change the name of the school appeared on 31 July 1881.
            The same year the first cadet battalion in Ceylon was formed at the college, attached to the Ceylon Light Infantry.
            The Royal College Union was formed in 1891 as the first alumni society in the country.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 1911, work commenced on a new building for the school on Reid Avenue.
            On November 1911 during construction of this building, it was hit by an aircraft that was trying the establish the record for the first flight over Ceylon in November 1911.
            On 27 August 1913 the school was moved to thin new building at Reid Avenue (which is now the main building of the University of Colombo).
            Ten years later on 10 October 1923, the school moved, this time to the newly constructed Victorian styled building further down Reid Avenue, which it continues to occupy.
            This move was due to the suggestion made by a higher education committee in 1914, that Royal College should be converted into a University college.
            Due to the objections made by past pupils of the Royal College Union, especially by the speeches made by Frederick Dornhorst, KC, the then Governor of Ceylon,
            Lord Chalmers instead created a separate University College, University College Colombo, at the school's former premises which became the University of Colombo in the later years.

            With the introduction of free education in Ceylon in 1931, Royal stopped charging fees from its students, thus proving education free of charge to this day
